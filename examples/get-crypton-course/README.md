This example shows how to create a chat bot for chat and for working with personal messages, so that the bot responds to the command “show crypton rate” and sends actual rate in response

How can you improve this bot:
1. Add new commands.
2. Add request processing via a queue.
3. Load application parameters from json, env or yaml configuration file.
